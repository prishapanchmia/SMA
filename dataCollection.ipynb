I only have one pair im a size 12 .... i bought them at the mall like 3 years ago grey/white there legit ... but a little snug length wise ...about 4 years ago my feet grew like a half a size and its really hard to find a 12.5 ... i haven&#39;t found one yet , i know they have them ....<br><br>I was gonna buy the New white/black /orange airmax 90 Infered ..... they were probably boot leg but try to pass them off as real and charge legit prices .<br><br>3/4 of the stuff in thevstore is shitty made clothes ect .. made in China probaly .... they have a few nice name brand clothes you can tell are made better but could just be a better knock off.<br>       Anyway he wantes $130 but said he would take $120 CASH .... the 12&#39;s were really tight at first , then he got size 13&#39;s wich i hate because the sneakers in that size always look so big and im 6&#39;2&quot; .... then i guess he lossened up all the laces in the size 12 cause i said the 13 are a little big , comfortable but like to long i had too much room from were my toe was ... put back on the 12&#39;s and were better , but id have to just tuck in the laces wich i do anyway sometimes, but they were still a tiny bit snug ....<br><br>Do you know a popular store that would carry size 12,5 ???  Also do you know if these sneakers comne in a larger width size like some do. <br>    I&#39;m in Long Island, Ny thats why i asked a popular store for example FOOTLOCKER , ect .... <br><br>Or even online ???  I really hate buying sneakers online because i like to try them on first , because certain sneakers are war to narrow for my feet ( I&#39;ve always just bought a regular size 12 and was good , now i gotta woory about 12 -13 and width )and if theres no free shipping returns its a pain in the ass .  <br>SORRY FOR THE BOOK I WROTE ANY HELP WOULD BE AWSOME , I ALWAYS LOVED AIR MAXES BUT REALLY HUST FELL IN LOVE WITG THEM CAUSE I CAN NOW AFFORD TGEM , BEFORE I HAD TO PRIORTIZE MY MONEY FIRST !!!!<br>  -   THANKS SO MUCH !!!!', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 90s all day', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: Air max 90 volt green black and grey', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 90', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 90&#39;s', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 97 all white', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 97s', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: air max plus nike bring air max plus back to nike', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: Air Max One', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: @Joaquín Toledo yess', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: Which air max is the lady wearing at the beginning of the video.. would appreciate the help', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: air max 270 react eng photon dust', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: AirMax react 270 ENG', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: The Air Max 97 gives me quivers... nothing is better than that sneaker in my opinion', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 270 or vapourmax plus', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: I love my silver bullets sm', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: 90s', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: airmax 90”s and 200’s', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: Air Max 2017', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: air max 720', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: Air max 1', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: air Max 2090', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: nordic air max 90s 😍😍😍', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: air max 97s worldwide edition', '  =>FIRST CALLBACK REPLY: One&#39;s.

Nike HATES the Light shoe I reckon as they continually fail to talk about it nor really  promote it as I think they don&#39;t see it as revolutionary enough to fit the storyline &amp; has never put the Walker back in production &amp;  Remember how the Light wasn&#39;t even included in the History Of Air Pack from a few years back? Big speel on the III&#39;s AKA 90&#39;s(rightly so)but almost nothing on the 180&#39;s. Nike obviously knows the love for the 90 now and promotes the crap out of it but it was&#39;nt the Top Dog for long  before the only real innovation the entire line has seen since &#39;87 was introduced with the 180.  Hardly any mention of the IV AKA Classic AKA BW, this shoe was the REAL UK Air Max, forget the talk on the 90&#39;s as that didn&#39;t happen until the late 90&#39;s &amp; re issues, the IV was massively popular everywhere from the get go! Once again a pass over on the ST &amp; the 270 AKA &#39;93  probably because this shoe is a true spiritual successor to the Light &amp; thus just a footnote* in the history *pun intended*. Nothing on the &#39;94, too light on the &#39;95 given the love thus shoe has. No Racer Max, no &#39;96 not enough depth on the &#39;97 the last passable decent looking Max &amp; popular then &amp; now. Nothing on 98&#39; TL, from memory though that one never really was worn by anyone. Plus&#39; hardly spoke about again despite it&#39;s massive popularity.  Deluxe&#39;s missed, Tuned Max&#39;s? Nothing &amp; this is another  rarity that should be highlighted. &#39;03s? No! Then again that was too golf shoe then &amp;  now. Then a skip to that truly awful 2090, hahahaha!
