Case Studies: In-depth investigation of a particular individual, group or event, it is used to gain an understanding of underlying principles.

Focus groups: A focus group is a small, but diverse group of people who participate in a guided discussion about a particular topic.

Online Data Collection: Data can be collected through online surveys, online interviews, online focus groups, online experiments, and online observations.

Document review: Analysis of existing documents, reports, or other written material

The choice of data collection method will depend on the research question, the type of data needed, and the resources available.


Alternative Methods:

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting large amounts of data from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to a website's server, downloading the HTML of the web page, and then parsing that data to extract the information you're interested in. Web scraping can be done using a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and C#.

Web scraping can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as data mining, data analysis, price comparison, sentiment analysis, and much more. It can be used to collect data from online sources such as social media, e-commerce websites, news websites, and so on.

Web scraping can be done manually, by writing code, or by using scraping tools such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Octoparse. These tools provide a simple interface for automating the process of making web requests, parsing the HTML and extracting the data you're interested in.

However, web scraping can also be illegal or violate the terms of service of a website, it is important to be aware of the legal issues surrounding web scraping and to obtain permission before scraping a website.

Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from source materials. In the context of analyzing the sentiment towards Apple, it refers to the process of determining the emotional tone behind words or phrases related to the company.

There are several methods for performing sentiment analysis on text data, including:

Dictionary-based methods: This method involves using a pre-defined dictionary of words and their associated sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) to classify the sentiment of a given text.

Machine learning-based methods: This method involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of text and associated sentiment, and then using the trained model to classify the sentiment of new text.

Neural network-based methods: This method involves using deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to classify the sentiment of text.

Sentiment analysis can be used to analyze text data from various sources such as social media, news articles, customer reviews, and more. It can be used to gain insights into customer opinions, measure brand reputation, and track changes in sentiment over time.

It is important to note that sentiment analysis is not always accurate and can be affected by context, sarcasm, irony, and other nuances of human language. Therefore, it is important to verify the results and use it as a tool for further investigation, not as a final conclusion.
